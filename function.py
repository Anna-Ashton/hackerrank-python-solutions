ðŸ§¾ The Code:

Edit
n = int(input())
result = ''.join(map(str, range(1, n + 1)))
print(result)
ðŸ§  Explanation:
1. n = int(input())
This line takes user input (which is a string), converts it to an integer, and stores it in the variable n.

For example, if the user types 5, then n = 5.

2. range(1, n + 1)
range(1, n + 1) creates a list of numbers starting from 1 up to and including n.

Example: If n = 5, this creates: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

3. map(str, range(1, n + 1))
map(str, ...) converts each integer in the range to a string.

Example: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]

4. ''.join(...)
This joins all the strings together into one long string with no space between them.

The '' means "join with an empty string".

Example: '1' + '2' + '3' + '4' + '5' = '12345'

5. print(result)
This prints the final string to the screen.

ðŸ”„ In Summary:
You're:

Getting a number from the user

Generating a list of numbers from 1 to that number

Turning those numbers into strings

Joining them all together

Printing the final string
